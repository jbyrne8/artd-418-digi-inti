          The Wolves is a play about a girls soccer team that debued Feb 13 at the Krannert Center. We were asked to design a captioning system for audience members that would adequately represent scenes where two or three conversations are going on simultaneously.

         To begin, we decided to design an AR experience for the Microsoft Hololens as their transparent glasses would be the least disorienting. Our idea was to communicate the relevance of dialogue, like a main conversation taking place at the same time as side conversations, using the size of text. We also wanted the lines of each character to appear above their heads so it would be obvious who was talking, but this was difficult to prototype. We instead designed a system for main conversations to be largest and at the top of the screen, where less important conersations were below and smaller, appearing to be on a plane behind the main conversation within a three dimensional space.
